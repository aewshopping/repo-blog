# A notes blog

_This readme file is autogenerated using the files in this repo, using the [readme generator file](/base/create-readme.md). Rebuild this file by running the [eleventy build workflow](learn/actions/workflows/eleventy-build.yaml)._

Below is an index of markdown notes stored in the [notes directory](/base/notes/), organised into `tag` groups. (Every note is automatically assigned the `all` tag.)

All markdown notes in the notes directory will be indexed. Using other file types or trying to use sub-directories in the notes folder will mean broken links due to the way links are being constructed - this is an easily-solveable-but-not-yet-solved problem!

{% for eachtag, notes in collections | dictsort -%}
<details>
<summary>

## `{{ eachtag }}` tag ({{ notes | length }} notes)</summary>
{% for note in notes -%}
- [{{ note.data.title }}](/base/notes/{{ note.page.fileSlug }}.md)
  {%- for tag in note.data.tags %} `{{ tag }}`{% endfor %}
{% endfor -%}
</details>
{% endfor -%}
