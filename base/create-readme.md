# A notes blog

_This readme file is autogenerated using the files in this repo, using the [readme generator file](/base/create-readme.md). Rebuild this file by running the [eleventy build workflow](learn/actions/workflows/eleventy-build.yaml)._

This page shows an index of markdown notes stored in the [notes directory](/base/notes/), organised into `tag` groups. (Every note is automatically assigned the `all` tag.)

All markdown notes in the `notes` directory will be indexed. Using other file types or trying to use sub-directories in the notes folder will mean broken links due to the way links are being constructed - this is an easily-solveable-but-not-yet-solved problem!
